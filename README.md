# camcan_aaic_2023
Code used for the generation of stats and figures for two posters at AAIC. 
One poster outlines the interaction effects with aging ('accelerated aging') and one outlines the interaction effects with anxiety and depression ('distinct neural correlates between cohorts').
The mediation analysis was inconclusive but is documented here for completeness.
